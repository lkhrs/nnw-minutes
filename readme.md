# Minutes for NetNewsWire

Inspired by [Simone Silvestroni's site](https://minutestomidnight.co.uk), Minutes uses Seravek for headings and Iowan Old Style for body text.

Based on the default theme for [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com). Font size has been bumped up 2px on macOS to bring the font size in line with Safari's reader view when using Iowan.

## Installation
